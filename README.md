# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The initial analysis that we ran for Pyber allowed us to view many trends in our data, trends related to city type that were based on drivers, and fares. You can find those trends in the PyBer.ipynb file withing this folder. While the analysis proved very useful, it is always good to summarize information when unloading that amount of information to your boss. In this Challenge I needed to summarize the data in terms of ride sharing data by city type and finally visualize this information in terms of total weekly fares for each city type. All of this will be helpful in aiding our Pyber make informative decisions on ride access and affortability.
