# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The initial analysis that we ran for Pyber allowed us to view many trends in our data, trends related to city type that were based on drivers, and fares. You can find those trends in the PyBer.ipynb file withing this folder. While the analysis proved very useful, it is always good to summarize our findings when unloading that amount of information to your boss. In this Challenge I needed to summarize the data in terms of ride sharing data by city type and finally visualize this information in terms of total weekly fares for each city type. All of this will be helpful in aiding our Pyber make informative decisions on ride access and affortability. 

## Results

### Differences in ride sharing data between the 3 city types

  In our "pyber_summary_df" image found below there is an anomally that sticks out between our "Total Rides" and "Total Drivers". We see that the rural and suburban city types both had more rides than drivers.

  The Urban data set had far more drivers than rides, with almost 800 more registered drivers than total rides. While the urban city type was far more successful in terms of "Total Fares", the averages per ride and driver was not quite as impressive. 

#### Key Figures to note about our summary:

- Highest Total Fares - "Urban : $39,854"
- Highest Average Fare per Ride - "Rural: $34.62"
- Highest Average Fare per Driver - "Rural: $55.49"

## Summary

Based on the data that we were able to accumulate, it is clear to see the contrast between Urban, Suburban and Rural cities. Based on the information we were able to accumulate with this analysis, it is clear where Pyber can make adjustments to improve accessibility and affortability.
